# Getting Started

This course is designed to build expertise in two key areas:
- Monte Carlo 
- Technical Writing

Engineering practice takes many forms, but at its core engineers are
defined by how they _innovate using quantifiable methods_. 

Monte Carlo is a skillset that uses random numbers to create
computational experiments. Monte Carlo experiments can quantify and predict a
number of outcomes e.g. deterministic parameters such as areas and
columes, probability of failure, propagation of error. 

Technical writing is a crucial skill to communicate innovations,
predictions, and results. Technical communication is the delivery of
technical information to readers in a manner that is adapted to their
needs, level of understanding, and background.  The ability to
"translate" technical information to nonspecialists is a key skill to
any technical communicator. 

Our first goal in the course is to practice technical reading and
writing to develop personal learning outcomes. 

**1.** Criticize and edit generative AI outcomes
    - Identify and revise passive voice constructions in technical writing 
    - Improve technical documents for conciseness by eliminating unnecessary words and redundancies
    - Proof read work to identify and improve technical communications
    - Quantify generalizations made by generative AI claims
    - Quantify changes in a doument to attribute authorship and
      intellectual property

**2.** **Discuss Uncertainty in Design:**
    - Perform statistical analysis of simulation data to extract meaningful insights
    - Present statistical findings clearly and concisely
    - Distinguish between qualitative (social) and quantitative
      (engineering) uncertainty in technical documents
    - Illustrate the importance of social uncertainty in engineering
      design

**5.** **Research Engineering Designs and Processes**
    - Find, review, and cite reliable sources of information (textbooks,
      articles, journals, news sources) 
    - Contextualize technical and social information to validate a design or process
    - Compose a unique case study in engineering decisions using data
      from models and sources
